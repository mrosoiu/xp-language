Introduction
------------
This patch introduces functionality suggested in the XP RFC 0008 (see
http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/co.php/rfc/0008.rfc.txt)

Currently implemented
---------------------
* Packages
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/packages

* Operator overloading
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/operator_overloading

* Throws clause
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/exceptions

* IException interface
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/exceptions

* Annotations:
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/syntax

* Instance creation expression:
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/syntax
  
* Allowing NULL for type-hinted parameters. Example:
  <?php
    class Client {
      public function setTrace(LogCategory $cat= NULL) {
        echo xp::typeOf($cat), "\n";
      }
    }
    $client= new Client();

    // Will print out "util.log.LogCategory"
    $client->setTrace(Logger::getInstance()->getCategory());

    // Will print out "NULL"
    $client->setTrace(NULL);

    // Will also print out "NULL"
    $client->setTrace(NULL);
  ?>  

Making it work
--------------
The patch needs to be applied against a current CVS checkout of PHP5. Go to
the Zend directory, run "php zend_vm_gen.php", compile, then run the tests. 

Be sure to do a "make clean" before - the zend_globals struct and 
zend_op_array structs have been changed (and therefore their size) - 
otherwise you'll experience crashes all over the place.
