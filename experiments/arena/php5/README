Introduction

This patch introduces functionality suggested in the XP RFC 0008 (see
http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/co.php/rfc/0008.rfc.txt)

* Operator overloading
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/operator_overloading

* Alternative array syntax:

Making it work
--------------
The patch needs to be applied against a current CVS checkout of PHP5.
Compile, then run the tests. 

Be sure to do a "make clean" before - the zend_globals struct and 
zend_op_array structs have been changed (and therefore their size) - 
otherwise you'll experience crashes all over the place.
