Operator overloading for PHP5: README
========================================================================
$Id$

Introduction
------------
This patch allows user-defined types to overload operators by defining 
static member functions using the operator keyword. Not all operators 
can be overloaded, however.

Operators           Overloadability
------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
++, --, !           These unary operators can be overloaded.

+, -, *, /, %       These binary operators can be overloaded.

+=, -=, *=, /=, %=  Assignment operators cannot be overloaded, but +=, 
                    for example, is evaluated using +, which can be 
                    overloaded.
</pre>

Basic syntax
------------
The key to operator overloading is the new keyword "operator". Apart
from that, the syntax is equal to that of a normal method declaration:

  class Integer {
    
    public static operator + (Integer $a, Integer $b) {
      // ...
    }
  }
