Operator overloading for PHP5: README
========================================================================
$Id$

Introduction
------------
This patch allows user-defined types to overload operators by defining 
static member functions using the operator keyword. Not all operators 
can be overloaded, however.

<pre>
Operators           Overloadability
------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
++, --              These unary operators can be overloaded.

+, -, *, /, %       These binary operators can be overloaded.

+=, -=, *=, /=, %=  Assignment operators cannot be overloaded, but +=, 
                    for example, is evaluated using +, which can be 
                    overloaded.
</pre>


Making it work
--------------
The patch needs to be applied against a current CVS checkout of PHP5.
Affected files in the Zend/ subdirectory:

zend_language_parser.y
zend_language_scanner.l
zend_operators.c

Compile, then run the tests (bigdecimal.php, complex.php).
