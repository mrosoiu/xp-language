Packages for PHP5: Exception changes
========================================================================
$Id$

1) Throws clause
----------------
The throws clause may be added to a method or function declaration to 
indicate what kind of exceptions it throws.

Basic syntax:

  class Socket {
    public function connect() throws IOException {
      // ...
    }
  }
  
Note: The exceptions are not checked, but the types of exceptions may be
retrieved via the reflection API. Example:

  $method= new ReflectionMethod('Socket', 'connect');
  foreach ($method->getExceptionTypes() as $ex) {
    Reflection::export($ex);
  }

Classes in the throws clause must be declared before the function 
declaration. Referencing previously undeclared classes will result in a
compile time fatal error.

2) IException interface
-----------------------
The builtin base class "Exception" need no longer be extended, it is 
sufficient to implement the IException interface. This interface is 
implemented by the built-in exception class. 

It is defined as following:

  interface IException {
    public function getMessage();
    public function getFile();
    public function getLine();
    public function __toString();
  }

Checks are performed on whether the exception thrown implements this 
interface (rather than checking on subclasses of Exception), therefore 
keeping the status quo of having a language enforcement on what
one can throw and "being clean".
