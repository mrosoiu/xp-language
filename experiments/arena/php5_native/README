This is a effort to try to get the XP framework to work with PHP 5 (currently 5.1.6).
The target should be to convert the repository from the one for PHP 4 with as minimal
manual interaction as possible.

Converting the repository
=========================
1. Removing the old generated files (optional)
   ./cleanup.sh
   
   This command removes all files, making place for the classes
   to be regenerated (files already existing will be skipped).

2. Convert the classes
   php4 convert.php <path/to/skeleton> <target>

   This converts all classes from the source skeleton to <target>,
   where <target> defaults to skeleton2

3. Copy over classes that need manual adjustment
   ./setup.sh

   Some classes need manual adjustments, so they're being commited
   to a separate place and being copied over to the target path
   after automatic conversion.

Converting a single class
=========================
1. Using migrate.php
  ./php4 migrate.php <fqcn>

2. Removing the target file and re-run convert.php from step 2 above.
   (recommended)

Running the unittests
=====================
sh run_tests.php
