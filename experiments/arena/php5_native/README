This is a effort to try to get the XP framework to work with PHP 5 (currently 5.1.4).
The target should be to convert the repository from the one for PHP 4 with as minimal
manual interaction as possible.

Converting the repo
-------------------
* execute convert.sh in the current directory. It will call migrate.php 
  for every class file in skeleton/ and put the newly generated class into
  skeleton2

* migrate.php is based on migrate.php from experiments/arena/php5/ but does not
  put the classes into own packages, making the resulting sourcecode syntactically
  PHP5 compatible

* classes won't be overwritten if the target file already exists


Running the unittests
=====================
* run unittests through run.php
* use default collection of unittests at trunk/util/tests/
