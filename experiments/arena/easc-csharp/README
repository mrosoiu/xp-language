EASC client implementation in C#
========================================================================
$Id$


Requirements
------------
.NET framework


Howto
-----
1) Build
   Run "make build" in this directory
   If you have the C# compiler in a different place than I do, use
   make build CSC=/path/to/csc.exe

2) Open a new shell to ../peking and start the PHP EASC server
   experiments/arena/peking$ php5 server.php 127.0.0.01
   
3) Run the TestRunner
   Run "make run" in this directory


Skeleton
--------
The entry point class is the Remote class from the Net.XpFramework.EASC
namespace. It provides a ForName() method which takes care of setting 
up the protocol from the DSN it is passed.

DSN syntax
<pre>
  scheme://[user:pass@]host[:port]
</pre>

Example
<code>
  Remote r = Remote.ForName("xp://localhost:6448");
  TestRunner runner = (TestRunner)r.Lookup("xp/test/TestRunner");
  
  // Now execute any methods on the runner proxy as if they were local
  object result= runner.runTestClass("net.xp_framework.unittest.core.ObjectTest");
</code>
