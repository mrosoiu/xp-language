What is this?
-------------
This is where experimental stuff should go, such as patches, case
studies, suggestions or scripts that may be of use. 

Subdirectories
--------------
+ people
  This is where your own experiments go. Everything which you 
  would consider "private" and of no particular interest for the
  rest. Though, remember, everyone can still read your files -
  don't put your credit card information here:)
  
+ arena
  Show-off stuff which could be of interest for everyone.
