XP Language experiment
========================================================================
$Id$


What's this?
------------
This is an experiment to show the feasibility of compiling XP sourcecode
to PHP5.


Getting started
---------------
* Ensure you have PHPJay compiled
  $ cd ../../../../ports/technologies/opt/jay/
  $ make

* Run "./configure"
  If the PHP5 cli binariy cannot be found automatically, try
  "./configure -c <path-to-php5-cli-binary>"
  
* Run "make test"
  Note: If you're using BSD, you'll have to use "gmake" instead of
  "make". Thanks for understanding:)
