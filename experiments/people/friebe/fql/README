What's this?
------------
FQL - Filesystem Query language, based on io.collections API (see RFCs
#0075 and #0077).


Getting started
---------------
1) Apply patch from RFC #0077 in skeleton/ - you'll find it here:
   http://xp-framework.net/rfc/contrib/rfc0077.diff
   
2) In this directory, type in a shell window:
   $ echo "select from collection('.')" | php fql.php -
   
   You should see a list of all files in this directory
