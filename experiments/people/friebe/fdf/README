What to do
----------
First, open demo1.pdf (it originates from planetpdf.com, you'll
need Acrobat Creator - payware - to create a PDF with fields in it).
See how there are two form fields without content. Don't pay
attention to the "Update" button for the moment - it's a webservice
integration demo from planetpdf - and not relevant to this experiment.

Second, open datetime.fdf with Acrobat Reader. Observe how the date
"2006-09-18" and the time "21:08:39 (7200)" gets filled in. This date
and time was the date and time when I last generated the FDF file:)

Third, run php mkfdf.php - it will update the FDF file with the 
current date and time on your system - re-opening the FDF will result
in the form fields showing the new values.
