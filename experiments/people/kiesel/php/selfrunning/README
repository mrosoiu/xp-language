About
------

This experiment shows how to produce a self-running, self-containing
.xar file without further dependencies (other than a version of
PHP5 available).


How to create and run a self-running archive
---------------------------------------------

These are the steps required to produce a self running archive:

1.* Copy the files from overrides/ that already exist in your
   public skeleton tree to that tree to overwrite the originals
   with the version supplied with this experiment.
 
2.* Create a xar file containing all framework classes:

  $ cd xp/trunk/skeleton
  $ xar cf ../xp-rt-current-`date +%Y%m%d`.xar .
  $ mv ../xp-rt* ../experiments/people/kiesel/php/selfrunning/
   
3. Run the CreateRunner xpcli:

   $ xpcli CreateRunner \
    --output=target.xar \
    --xar=/path/to/existing.xar \
    --main=tld.package.RunningClass
    
   --output denotes the new xar
   --xar    the existing xar to include
   --main   main class which should be run automatically
            (this needs to be a special class)

3. Run the new xar
   
   $ php [-dinclude_path=""] target.xar -class [<runner-class>]
   
   By default, the main class picked upon generating the xar
   will be run, this can be overriden through the <runner-class>
   parameter.
   
   No further files than the xar should be required for
   running the application.
   
   Example:
   $ php -dinclude_path="" runner.xar -class net.xp_framework.experiments.ShowContents.class.php
   
   (This command should output the contents of its own xar file)

Status
-------

Step 1)
Already available through XP infrastructur. This step will not be
necessary, once this experiment will be merged into the official 
tree.

Step 2)
Implemented.

Step 3)
Implemented, on an experimental base. Currently every class is being
treated as a xpcli-style Command class.
For general purpose applications (eg. in a webserver), we'd probably
not want to use a Command - this is just hardcoded this way for 
simplicity.


Outlook
--------
This experiment is the proof-of-concept that creating a self-extracting
and running .xar archive with the complete XP framework and one or
even many applications in the single file does work.

What needs to be done to get this into the official distribution?
* file an RFC for the whole concept
* decide what the runner.ini should look like and whether we need
  it at all
* decide what classes should be supported, possibly build a common
  infrastructure for all kinds of scripts (scriptlet, command, ...)
* decide whether the self-running xars should have a different
  file extension (clickability)
