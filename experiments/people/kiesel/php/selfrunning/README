This experiment shows how to produce a self-running, self-containing
.xar file without further dependencies (other than a version of
PHP5 available).


How to create and run a self-running archive
---------------------------------------------

These are the steps required to produce a self running archive:

1. You need to supply a .xar containing *all* files 
   by yourself, it will not be generated here.

2. Run the CreateRunner xpcli:

   $ xpcli CreateRunner \
    --output=target.xar \
    --xar=/path/to/existing.xar \
    --main=tld.package.RunningClass
    
   --output denotes the new xar
   --xar    the existing xar to include
   --main   main class which should be run automatically
            (this needs to be a special class)

3. Run the new xar
   
   $ php target.xar [<runner-class>]
   
   By default, the main class picked upon generating the xar
   will be run, this can be overriden through the <runner-class>
   parameter.
   
   No further files than the xar should be required for
   running the application.
