   * vCalendar defines a transport and platform-independent format for exchanging 
   * calendaring and scheduling information in an easy, automated, and consistent 
   * manner. It captures information about event and "to-do" items that are
   * normally used by applications such as a personal information managers (PIMs) 
   * and group schedulers. Programs that use vCalendar can exchange important data 
   * about events so that you can schedule meetings with anyone who has a vCalendar-
   * aware program.
