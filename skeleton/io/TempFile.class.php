  /**
   * Represents a temporary file
   *
   * Example:
   * <code>
   *   uses('io.TempFile');
   *
   *   $f= &new TempFile();
   *   $f->open(FILE_MODE_WRITE);
   *   $f->write('Hello');
   *   $f->close();
   *
   *   printf('Created temporary file "%s"', $f->getURI());
   * </code>
   *
   * Note: The temporary file is not deleted when the file
   * handle is closed (e.g., a call to close()), this will have
   * to be done manually.
   *
   * Note: A possible race condition exists: From the time the
   * file name string is created (when the constructor is called)
   * until the time the file is opened (in the call to open)
   * another process may also open and/or create a file with the
   * same name. This would have to happen within the same 
   * microsecond, though, and is therefore quite unlikely.
