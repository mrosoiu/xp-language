------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Framework
============

* Features/Wishlist:

  - DBA classes (php://dba)
  
  - Interface to DomXML, generalize via xml.dom and xml.sax
  
  - Interface to DomXSL / EXSL
  
  - Java Interface via ext/java (Prerequisite: Compile PHP
    --with-java successfully)
    
  - PostgreSQL/Oracle/... rdbms classes
  
  - img.graph additions to draw real statistical data
  
  - Generic ACL class
  
* Experimental:

  - Finish CHM support
  
  - Finish Excel support
  
  - Finish WSDL support
  
  - Finish xni
  
  - Finish VCard/VCalendar (what's missing there, anyway?)
  
  - Finish security/Policy
  
  - Finish telephony API (use same model with connection 
    listeners as in peer.irc/peer.server APIs)
  
  - Come to a consensus about org.apache.xml.workflow. This
    API is needed but still not fully functional!

2) Documentation
=================

* Include ports

* Include SAPIs (TBD: figure out how documentation could be 
  automatically generated)

* Bug system (based on bugzilla, Prerequisite: Install 
  MySQL/PHPMyAdmin on php3.de)

* Development: xp@php3.de Mailing list archive
  TBD: Find nice output format, most ml archives are the pure horror
  to browse through

* Some kind of tutorial/FAQ section

* User annotations (where to put? Sybase? Maintain how?)

3) Generic
==========

* Finally decide on official logo.

* ChangeLog / NEWS generation for display on resources page.

* Think of a really cool ports system and installer.

* Write a dependency tracker that will find out all dependencies
  for a given script or class, thus making CVS tagging and 
  installation easiert.

4) PHP5 / ZE2 / The future
==========================

* Find out if package/namespace support will be included in 5.0-STABLE
  I guess we could live without as we do right now...
  Change migration script (and thus unb0rk experiments/skeleton2)

<EOF>
