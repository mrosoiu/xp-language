RFC 0137: Retrieve class tags through reflection
========================================================================

@status: draft
@category: <core>

Scope of Change
---------------
The various @-style apidoc tags through XP's reflection
API.

Rationale
---------
Contains some additional information. In some rare situations
one might want to access those.

Functionality
-------------
A new method getTagByName() will be added to lang.XPClass.

Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a

Speed impact
------------
Slightly slower as an additional array element must be
created and one further preg_match() call is executed upon
retrieving class details.

Dependencies
------------

  This simplifies retrieving @test tags for unittests, which
  is why I came to this.

  Maybe @test should be made an annotation in this case? These
  are already retrievable by reflection at runtime...

  Reset to draft, I don't really like the idea of using apidoc
  tags at runtime - as said, this is what annotations already
  provide. Something like @tests(testone.name, testtwo.name)
  also doesn't really make me happy, though...
