@status: implemented (Sat Jun 18 22:57:19 CEST 2005)
@category: <ports>

Scope of Change
---------------
The release process of XP applications ("ports") will be changed to be more
flexible when it comes to make post-release changes or bugfixes and will also
be adapted to subversion.

Rationale
---------
With the migration to subversion, the release- and install-process needs to be
changed that it works with svn.

Because the release- and install-process requires CVS-tags and as tags do no 
longer exist in subversion, the process needs to be modified.

Functionality
-------------

The old process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Up to now, the release process includes the following steps:
a) tagging all files required be the application with a *_RELEASE tag
b) execution the install target to checkout the port on the target machine(s)
   or in the packaging enviroment (where .tar.gz's could be made)

The new process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The new process will consist of these steps:
a) creating a new branch in the branches/<appname-release> directory where all 
   required files for the release are copied to [1,3]
b) once the branch has settled, copy the whole branch to the tags/<appname-release>
   directory. [2]
c) execute the install target which checks out tags/<appname-release> on the
   target machine(s)

Notes
~~~~~
[1] The repositories directory structure would then look like
    xp/trunk/
            /skeleton
            /ports
            ...
      /branches/application-release/
                                   /skeleton
                                   /ports
                                   ...
      /tags/application-release/
                               /skeleton
                               /ports
                               ...

[2] Though bugfixes may be incorporated into the branch, no real development
    will happen in branches/ or tags/

[3] Step a) may be skipped if stability and the possibility to do bugfixing in
    the branch are not required.
    
Branch / tag names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generally branch / tag names are made up of several parts:
  * application short name (eg. WEBSITE)
  * version indicator, which can be one of
    . pre-releases (indicated by `RC`)
    . the release (`RELEASE`)
    . post-releases a.k.a. service packs (`SP`)

For convencience, the symbolic name HEAD exists, which can be used 
to check out trunk/. All names are in uppercase.

Some examples:
  "WEBSITE_RELEASE": release version of application website
  "WEBSITE_RC_5_0": release candidate 5.0 of `website`
  "WEBSITE_SP_1_0": servicepack 1.0 of `website`

The paths these will be installed in are directly derived from
the names of the tags. The rule for this derivation is
`xp.` + lowercased tagname. Underscore will be replaces by dash and
a dash preceding a digit is be removed.
