Scope of Change
---------------
The release process of XP applications ("ports") will be changed to be more
flexible when it comes to make post-release changes or bugfixes and will also
be adapted to subversion.

Rationale
---------
With the migration to subversion, the release- and install-process needs to be
changed that it works with svn.

Because the release- and install-process requires CVS-tags and as tags do no 
longer exist in subversion, the process needs to be modified.

Functionality
-------------

The old process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Up to now, the release process includes the following steps:
a) tagging all files required be the application with a *_RELEASE tag
b) execution the install target to checkout the port on the target machine(s)
   or in the packaging enviroment (where .tar.gz's could be made)

The new process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The new process will consist of these steps:
a) creating a new branch in the branches/<appname-release> directory where all 
   required files for the release are copied to [1,3]
b) once the branch has settled, copy the whole branch to the tags/<appname-release>
   directory. [2]
c) execute the install target which checks out tags/<appname-release> on the
   target machine(s)

Notes
~~~~~
[1] The repositories directory structure would then look like
    xp/trunk/
            /skeleton
            /ports
            ...
      /branches/application-release/
                                   /skeleton
                                   /ports
                                   ...
      /tags/application-release/
                               /skeleton
                               /ports
                               ...

[2] Though bugfixes may be incorporated into the branch, no real development
    will happen in branches/ or tags/

[3] Step a) may be skipped if stability and the possibility to do bugfixing in
    the branch are not required.
