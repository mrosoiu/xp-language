Scope of Change
---------------
Classes used by command line utilities but not in xp-rt will be added
to a new XAR file called xp-tools.xar


Rationale
---------
Separate classes currently in xp-net.xp_framework.xar and used for core
utilities from unittests.


Functionality
-------------
The classes from the following packages will be moved to the new tools
infrastructure:

* net.xp_framework.xar - xar command classes
* net.xp_framework.db.generator - DataSet code generator
* net.xp_framework.wsdl.cmd - WSDL code generator


Package contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All classes inside the tools directory reside in the "xp" package.

<pre>
  xp
  |- codegen           # Classes for the "cgen" utility
  |  |- dataset
  |  |- esdl
  |  `- wsdl
  |- doclet            # Classes for the "doclet" utility
  |- runtime           # Classes for the "xp" utility
  |- unittest          # Classes for the "unittest" utility
  |- command           # Classes for the "xpcli" utility
  `- xar               # Classes for the "xar" utility
</pre>

The classes for the "xpcli" utility will stay in the util.cmd package
for backwards compatibility reasons but will be deprecated and later
removed.


Entry point
~~~~~~~~~~~
As PHP always needs an entry point PHP file, the following files will
represent them:

* class.php - class runner (classes with public static main method)
* xar.php - xar runner (xars with a META-INF/manifest.ini poiting to main-class
* web.php - web runner


Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a


Speed impact
------------
Faster, xp-net.xp_framework.xar can be dropped from core dependencies and 
the replacing xp-tools.xar will be smaller in size


Dependencies
------------
None.
