@status: draft
@target: 5.8.0
@category: <core>

Scope of Change
---------------
Calls to <tt>exit()</tt> will be replaced by a method that throws a
<tt>lang.SystemExit</tt> exception.


Rationale
---------
Be able to catch sourcecode that tries to exit.


Functionality
-------------
Take into consideration the following:

<code>
  class Grep extends Command {
  
    public function bail($message) {
      $this->err->writeLine('*** ', $message);
      exit(1);
    }
    
    public function run() {
      // ...

      if (!...) {
        $this->bail('Could not ...');
      }

      // ...
    }
  }
</code>

The problem here is this code was run inside, say, a GUI to show all
available Command classes and execute them by clicking on buttons, 
the entire process would exit instead. This is of course not intended.

Instead, we simply want a simple means to exit from the <tt>run()</tt>
method.

Changes to code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So this is what has to change in the Command class:
<pre>
  - exit(1);
  + System::doExit(1);
</pre>

On the calling side, we can now do the following:
<code>
  $runner= xp·command·Runner();
  try {
    $runner->run(new ParamString(array_merge(array($class), $args)));
  } catch (SystemExit $e) {
    // ...
  }
</code>


Security considerations
-----------------------
None.


Speed impact
------------
Exiting will be slightly slower due to the overhead throwing an exception
adds.


Dependencies
------------
None.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Maybe "yield" would be a name (http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/yield)
since we are returning control to the (operating) system:
<summary>
[...]
6) to give (something) over to the control or possession of another usually 
under duress [refusing to yield the city to enemy troops] - see surrender 1
[...]
</summary>

I'm not particularily happy with <tt>System::doExit()</tt> as method name,
<tt>System::exit()</tt> would be better, but as exit is a keyword in PHP,
we can't name it that.
