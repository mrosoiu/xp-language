Scope of Change
---------------
The PHP5 core would be changed in numerous ways. This would include new
syntax, less restrictions and more features, realized via patches to the
Engine and other sourcecode.

Rationale
---------
PHP5 has decent OO support but is somewhat restricive in some areas and
misses some nice features. The PHP development team has strong feelings 
on some of the suggested changes (partially due to BC reasons, partially
due to personal views on what is "right" and what is "wrong", partially
because the "PHP is not Java / C# / Perl / Delphi / ..." syndrome or 
"because this makes PHP too complex"), thus preventing them from being 
realized.

Functionality
-------------
The following changes would be incorporated into the new Engine:

a) Syntax changes and additions
* A keyword "with"
+ An optional throws clause to methods
* A catch-all-exceptions mechanism
+ Packages support
* A package access level
* Enumerations
+ Annotations support
* Finally
* Keywords would be allowed as class and method names where possible
* Automated getters and setters
* Default members
* A keyword "synchronized"
* Return type hints (unchecked, may be retrieved via Reflection)
+ Class instance creation expressions

b) New features
+ Operator overloading

c) Removed restrictions
* No implementation check during inheritance
+ Userland exceptions would no longer be forced to extend from the
  built-in exceptions
+ An interface would be added to identify an exception. Userland
  classes would have to implement it
  
d) Removed cruft
* Magic quotes would completely disappear
* register_globals would be nuked
* Compat mode with Zend Engine 1

e) Changes in errorhandling
* NULL->method() would result in a NullPointer instead of Fatal errors
* Passing an incorrect argument to a type-hinted parameter would result
  in an IllegalArgument

f) Configuration
* Safe mode (and alike) would be replaced by a permission manager

Details
-------
* The keyword "with":
  with introduces a block of code which is auto-populated by a variable
  named "self".
  <?php
    with ($tree->addNode(new Node('child'))) {
      $self->setAttribute('id', 10);
      $self->setAttribute('name', $name);
    }
  ?>

+ An optional throws clause to methods:
  As in Java, one may add a throws clause to methods that indicates 
  which exceptions are thrown from it.
  <?php
    public function connect() throws IOException, ConnectException {
      // ...
    }
  ?>
  This clause is, of course, optional and no checks are inferred from
  it (e.g., the caller of this method is not required to catch these
  exceptions). The reflection API provides a way to retrieve these
  exceptions.
  
  For details, see
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/exceptions
  
* A catch-all-exceptions mechanism:
  Catch-all is realized by ommitting the exception type from the 
  catch clause. 
  <?php
    try {
      // ...
    } catch ($e) {
      // ...
    }
  ?>
  
  This is identical to writing "catch (IException $e)" (see also:
  add an interface instead of built-in exception).
  
+ Packages support
  A new keyword "package" begins a block of code that puts every 
  contained class, interface or enumeration (see below) into it.
  <?php
    package lang {
      class Object { }
      class String extends Object { }
    }
  ?>
  The package-class-separator is the tilde character (~). Thus, the
  String class can be addressed by its fully qualified name, 
  "lang~String" (the fully qualified name is the only way to 
  address packaged elements in a generic way).
  
  An additional function called "import" creates short aliases for 
  these long names.
  <?php
    import lang~String, lang~Object;
    import de~schlund~webservices~ServiceLocator as Locator;
  ?>
  Name clashes cause a Fatal (Compile-Time) Error.

  For details, see 
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/packages

* A package access level:
  The package keyword may also be prefixed to a method to declare its
  access level package-wide (in addition to public, private and 
  protected).
  <?php
    package io {
      class File {
        package function handle() { }
      }
    }
  ?>

* Enumerations:
  A new keyword "enum" is introduced.
  <?php
    enum Suit { CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES }
  ?>

  Enumerations have a static function "values()" that returns the
  values as an array.
  <?php
    foreach (Suit::values() as $value) { }
  ?>

  The sizeof() function applied to an enumeration returns the numbers 
  of elements in an enumeration (for the above example, 4).
  
+ Annotations support:
  Annotations (metadata) may be embedded within the sourcecode using
  the @ sign to prefix them.
  <?php
    class SoapClient {
      @debug('level=1') public function setTrace(LogCategory $log) {
      }

      @remote public function invoke($params) throws InvokationException {
      }
    }
  ?>
  
  The Reflection API offers a way to retrieve these annotations.

  For details, see 
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/syntax
  
* Finally:
  A new keyword finally is introduced which is called regardless of 
  whether an exceptions is raised or not.
  <?php
    try {
      // ...
    } catch (IOException $e) {
      // ...
    } finally {
      $file->close();
    }
  ?>

* Keywords would be allowed as class and method names where possible
  The keywords class, array, list and so on would be allowed as class
  an method names (where unambiguous):
  <?php
    class List { }
  ?>
  
* Automated getters and setters:
  A new form of declaring getters and setters for variables would be
  introduced:
  <?php
    class String {
      public $buffer get $buffer set setBuffer;
    }

    $s= new String();
    $s->buffer= 'Hello';   // calls setBuffer() with 'Hello' as argument
    var_dump($s->buffer);  // reads member "buffer"
  ?>

* Default members:
  A member of a class may be declared as the default member and would
  allow for some sort of "operator" overloading:
  <?php
    class List {
      public default $items;
    }
    
    $list= new List();
    $list[]= 'a';       // Appends 'a' to the member "items"
  ?>

* A keyword "synchronized":
  The keyword "synchronized" would protect a block from being executed
  more than once from simultaneously running threads or even instances.
  <?php
    synchronized {
      // ...  
    }
  ?>
  
  The synchronized directive takes an optional model as argument (compare
  to "declare(ticks=1)"). Using the model "flock", one could prevent, for
  example, a cron job from running twice at the same time.
  <?php
    synchronized(model=flock) {
      // ...  
    }
  ?>
  
  When a synchronized block is hit and another instance tries to execute
  the same code, it would have to wait for the first instance to finish
  before being able to continue.

+ Class instance creation expression
  A class instance creation expression is used to create new objects that 
  are instances of classes.
  
  Example 1:
  <?php
    abstract class Comparator {
      abstract public function compare($a, $b);
    }

    class ArrayList {
      public function sort(Comparator $c) {
        usort($this->elements, array($c, 'compare'));
      }
    }

    $list->sort(new Comparator() {
      public function compare($a, $b) {
        return strnatcmp($a, $b);
      }
    });
  ?>
  In this case, the class being instantiated is a subclass of the 
  Comparator class.

  Example 2:
  <?php
    interface class Comparator {
      public function compare($a, $b);
    }

    class ArrayList {
      public function sort(Comparator $c) {
        usort($this->elements, array($c, 'compare'));
      }
    }

    $list->sort(new Comparator() {
      public function compare($a, $b) {
        return strnatcmp($a, $b);
      }
    });
  ?>
  In this case, the class being instantiated is a class implementing
  the Comparator interface.

+ Operator overloading
  For details, see 
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/operator_overloading

* No implementation check during inheritance
  The following would not be checked upon (not even in strict mode):
  <?php
    class Window {
      function show(Point $point) { }
    }
    
    class MyWindow extends Window {
      function show() { 
        parent::show(new Point(100, 200));
      }
    }
  ?>
  Currently, this would give an E_STRICT warning
  
+ Userland exceptions would no longer be forced to extend from the
  built-in exception. An interface would be added to identify an exception. 
  Userland classes would have to implement it.

  For details, see
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/exceptions
  
* Magic quotes would completely disappear
  Magic quotes are a big nuisance and don't protect you from 
  anything. The magic quotes on request variables as well as the
  magic quotes that are applied at runtime would no longer exist.

* register_globals would be nuked
  The only way to access HTTP request data is via the $_*-
  superglobals or via the php://input stream.
  
* Compat mode with Zend Engine 1
  The compatibility mode is kept for backwards compatibility und
  would be removed. It's not like this new engine would be compatible
  with PHP4 anyway.
  
* NULL->method() would result in a NullPointer instead of Fatal errors
  Calling a member function of a non-object can be safely caught and would
  therefore cause a php~NullPointerException to be raised instead of a 
  fatal error

* Passing an incorrect argument to a type-hinted parameter would result
  in an IllegalArgument
  <?php
    function add(int $a, int $b) { }
    
    add(1, '2');    // php~IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
  ?>

* Safe mode (and alike) would be replaced by a permission manager
  The permission manager would offer a much more open API for systems
  administrators to control exactly what a user is able to do and
  what not.
