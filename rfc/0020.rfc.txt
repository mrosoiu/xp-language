Scope of Change
---------------
The unit testing API will make use of the new metadata facility described 
in RFC #0016.

Rationale
---------
Instead of having to having to rely on method names beginning with the 
string "test" or having to supply all test methods from "the outside",
test methods can be simply marked with the annotation @test.

Functionality
-------------

Basic usage
~~~~~~~~~~~
The "test" tag is used to identify methods to be used as a test. This 
attribute tells the framework that a particular method in the test case
is to be run during the unit testing phase.

Example:
<?php
  class ParserTest extends TestCase {
  
    #[@test]
    function tokenOrder() {
      // ...
    }
  }
?>

Ignoring certain tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes when a unit test is not ready for testing, it is good to ignore 
that test while still being able to run the other tests. To that end, it
is allowed to set an @ignore attribute on a test method. Just as the name 
would imply, this attribute will cause the method or class to be ignored 
when the unit tests are run.

Example:
<?php
  class ComplexNumbersTest extends TestCase {
  
    #[@test]
    function testAddition() {
      // ...
    }

    #[@test, @ignore('Not yet implemented')]
    function testDivision() { }
  }
?>

Dependencies

- RFC #0016
