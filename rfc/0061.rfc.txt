@category: scriptlet, <core>

Scope of Change
---------------
Several places in the scriptlet-API will be changed to use
scriptlet.HttpScriptletRequest::getEnvValue() instead of a
direct getenv() call.

Several places in the scriptlet-API will be changed to use
scriptlet.HttpScriptletRequest::getParam()/hasParam() methods
instead of accessing $_REQUEST/$_GET/$_POST/... directly.

The following is the list of restricted methods/variables:
. $_GET
. $_POST
. $_REQUEST
. $_COOKIE
. getenv()
. putenv()
. getallheaders()
. header()

Rationale
---------
In order to setup a scriptlet engine within a scriptlet-controlled
environment, access to the "outer" environment must be prevented. By
overriding the getEnvValue()/getParam()/...-methods this can be done.
The raw access cannot be overriden.

It's clear that there is no way of really intercepting access and 
calls to the raw data; so this document states the fact, it's for-
bidden, no further control is being done.

Violating the rule leads to undefined application behaviour by
definition.

Speed impact

  should $_SERVER also be restricted?
