Scope of Change
---------------
A new class will be introduced that registeres a new PHP userland streme
scheme xsl://. This scheme will then be used to reference XSL stylesheets.

XML scriptlet applications can then use that new stream wrapper to reference
their XSL files instead of pointing to them via a standard filesystem relation.

Rationale
---------
Today, xsl files are shipped mostly to use the stylesheets in a XP scriptet
application. To use them, a XSL processor would be set up and given the path
to the main xsl directory (usually this is xsl/ on the same level as doc_root/).

Now, this setup call would be replaced by a call to the newly introduced 
template loading class - XSLTemplateLoader. Any XSL file could then be referenced
by the new scheme and a local path, eg.: xsl://my/template.xsl. This path
is an absolute path, no longer a relative path dependend on where the processor
is called from.

XSLTemplateLoader will then use the ClassLoader chain to search and load the
referenced files; this adds the ability to add XSL locations to the classpath
and to ship XSL templates within XAR-archives, just as classes.

Functionality
-------------
A new stream wrapper class will be added and register xsl://. When passing a
stylesheet to an XSL processor instance, its path needs to use that sheme.

The XSLTemplateLoader will then be used to look up the location and load that
template by using the ClassLoader chain and adding the prefix XSL-INF as a
path element.

Thus, when the file xsl://xsl/file/to/load.xsl is requested, the following
happens;
1. the path expression will be converted into a translated corresponding path:
   "XSL-INF/xsl/file/to/load/xsl"
2. The ClassLoader chain will be asked for the ClassLoader delegate that
   can deliver that file.
3. If a ClassLoader declares it can deliver this file, it will be used to
   actually load that file.

If - within the XSL translation process - there are more stylesheets that need
to be loaded (implied by xsl:include or xsl:import), these can use relative
path expressions to load XSL files from the same scope (eg. same project) or
use an absolute path expression, but omitting the scheme xsl://. The subsequent
calls to load files will then be dispatched to the XSLTemplateLoader auto-
matically.
