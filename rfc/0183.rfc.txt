Scope of Change
---------------
A new scheme handler for res:// will be added as lang.ResourceProvider. This
scheme provides access to files provided by the classloader infrastructure.


Rationale
---------
Some PHP APIs can use data from streams, but not from classloaders directly.
The newly added file will provide a bridge for that gap.

For example, XSL files used by libxml through xml.DomXSLProcessor can be
loaded from a .xar file or a filesystem path equivalently now.

Functionality
-------------
The class lang.ResourceProvider will register the scheme res:// and will
delegate access requests to the default classloader.


Security considerations
-----------------------
- It is considered to be more secure, as access to files outside the
  paths provided by the classloader infrastructure are no longer accessible
  by calls like <xsl:include href="../../../../../../../etc/passwd"/>

Speed impact
------------
n/a

Dependencies
------------

Comments
--------
- As there is no BC break and major functionality change, include this into
  the 5.7-series of the XP framework.

- Strip down functionality of lang.ResourceProvider so it just serves the
  purpose of bridging the gap between classloaders and native PHP functions /
  extensions
