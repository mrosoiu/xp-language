Scope of Change
---------------
The unittest API should be extended to support some of the annotation 
based features that will be introduces with JUnit 4.0.

These annotations include
  . @expect
  . @timeout

Rationale
---------
Sometimes one might not want to check for certain return values. Issueing
exceptions to check error handling code is even quite common. 
The annotation `@expect` will simplify the common case where one needs to
check that a specific exception has been thrown.

The annotation @timeout can be used to check the runtime behaviour of
a method.

Functionality
-------------
The @expect annotation takes the name of the expected exception:
<?php
  #[@test, @expect('lang.IllegalArgumentException')]
  function testMyFault() {
    $object= &new MyExceptionThrowingClass();
    $object->throwExpectedException();
  }
?>

The @timeout annotation takes the amount of seconds a method may take
to execute.
<?php
  #[@test, @timeout(13)]
  function testTimeout() {
    // Call lengthy method
    lengthyMethod();
  }
?>

The method will be interrupted if it didn't complete within the time
specified and the result will be assumed as failed.

Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a

Speed impact
------------
Of course, exception handling is a slow thing, but this doesn't count
for unit testing.

Dependencies
------------
- ext/pcntl for the timeout thing

Comments
--------
- testing timeouts seems a bit vague - runtime behavior may be affected by
  a whole lot of things. Maybe we have no application for this, then.

- the resolution of pcntl_alarm is seconds - this may be too much for 
  fine-grained checks. If one can live without the method being interrupted
  but only profiled for its execution time, the resolution can be increased.
  Then, again, the question is if there aren't too many external influences
  for this.
  JUnit 4's @timeout annotation specifies the timeout in milliseconds.

- the attached patch implements the @expect attribute; it does not implement
  the timeout as I personally think that it is not of use enough. Someone
  may come up with another patch or convince me:)
  The @expect attribute has also been changed to take the fully qualified
  classname of the exception class.

- The @expect annotation was implemented. If @timeout makes sense (and 
  because it doesn't work under Windows) we can implement it later.
