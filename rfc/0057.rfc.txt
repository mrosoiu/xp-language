@category: util.adt

Scope of Change
---------------
The package util.adt will be renamed to util.collections and in the same
step changed and extended to contain generic classes and interfaces to 
replace PHP's array-functions for objects.


Rationale
---------
PHP's array-functionality doesn't deal with objects very well.
Especially, object equality isn't redefineable.


Functionality
-------------
Quick overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following classes will be changed:
* util.collections.Stack
* util.collections.Set
* util.collections.HashSet
* util.collections.Queue
* util.collections.LRUBuffer

The following classes will be added:
* util.collections.HashTable

The following utility classes and interfaces will be added:
* util.collections.HashImplementation
* util.collections.DJBX33AHashImplementation
* util.collections.HashProvider
* util.collections.Map


Extensions to existing classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The classes util.collections.Stack, util.collections.HashSet and 
util.collections.Queue will be extended by hashCode() and equals() 
methods. 

The interface util.collections.Set will be extended to contain the 
methods hashCode() and equals().


Changes to existing classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The class util.collections.LRUBuffer will be changed to work with 
objects instead of primitives. This results in a BC break but will 
make the class consistent with the rest of the classes in this 
package.


New classes
~~~~~~~~~~~
The util.collections.HashTable class will be added. It is a hash table 
consisting of non-null objects as keys and values and implements
the new util.collections.Map interface.

The util.collections.HashProvider class serves as the entry-level class 
for all classes using hashing. It is a singleton and knows about one
single (changeable) implementation defaulting to "DJBX33A" (Daniel 
J. Bernstein, Times 33 with Addition) implemented in the class
util.collections.DJBX33AHashImplementation.


Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~
The util.collections package comes with two interfaces, Set and Map, which
define the behaviour of the HashSet and HashTable classes. Future 
extensions such as a IdentityHashMap, a revised version of the current
util.HashMap or IdentitySet should implement these interface.


Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a


Speed impact
------------
n/a


Dependencies
------------
- BC: The LRUBuffer class will no longer support primitives

  Maybe the lang.Collection and util.HashMap classes should be migrated
  here, too.

- friebe, Sun Apr 30 12:48:02     2006
  The patch contains a set of unit tests (in a new package named
  net.xp_framework.util.adt) to verify the classes' behaviour.

  Maybe util.collections would be a better name for this package? It
  would emphasize the package's contents.
