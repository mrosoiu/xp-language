Scope of Change
---------------
AbstractXMLScriptlet will no longer receive a ClassLoader instance
in their constructor call. Instead the "base" package name under which
classes for the website reside will be passed as string.

Rationale
---------
A classloader object is created with the package name that indicates
where to load the scriptlet's state classes and context from. A
classloader constructed with
<code>
  $cl= &new ClassLoader('net.xp_framework');
</code>

will load classes from that package only. However, it will fail to
do so when those classes would be in an archive, as a classloader
always only loads classes from its own repository.

Functionality
-------------
The AbstractXMLScriptlet will be passed the base package name as string
and use XPClass::forName() to load required classes.

Security considerations
-----------------------
Narrow down class availability to classes contained in a package is
not a security feature, so n/a.

Speed impact
------------
n/a

Dependencies
------------
n/a

  This change could be done in a BC-break free manner. I chose to supply a
  patch *with* BC break, because otherwise we'd end up with all classes
  mixing between new and old style.
  Only new style (passing a string) should be supported in the end, and
  changing existing classes is quite easy in this case.
