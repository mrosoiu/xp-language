Scope of Change
---------------
Remove destruction mechanism in lang.base.php. Destruction methods will
be registered for each object by the method Object::Object() if a
__destruct method is declared for that object.

Rationale
---------
The current destruction mechanism built into XP's core relies on the
$GLOBALS array: for each object in $GLOBALS that is a child of 
lang.Object, the destructor will be called.

Thus, every object inherits a default "dummy" destructor that will 
be called, no matter if it's overridden and actually does something
or not.

Also, not every object is in $GLOBALS, so not every destructor will be
actually called - at least, one may not rely on it.

Functionality
-------------
The __destroy() method in lang.base.php will be removed, as well as
the default __destruct() method in lang.Object.

At the same time, Object::Object() will be changed to register a 
class instance's __destruct() method as a shutdown function via 
the  register_shutdown_function, if the class implements one.

Because lang.Object does no longer have a __destruct() method, those
classes currently defining a __destruct() method must be changed, so
they won't call the parent::__destruct() any more; this is a small
BC breakage!

Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a

Speed impact
------------
There are some effects that have to be taken into account:
- lang.Object does no longer have a dummy destructor that
  gets called unnecessarily (faster)
- formerly, not all destructors would really be called, while
  now they will. (slower)
- lang.base.php will shrink and it's destroy() method no longer
  be called. (faster)

Overall, the speed could be marginally slower, with the benefit of
having the security of guaranteed destructors.

Dependencies

  Destructors don't work this way with objects that are assigned to
  static variables, as they are commonly used in singletons.
