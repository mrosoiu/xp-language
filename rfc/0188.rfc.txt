RFC 0188: Test outcome
========================================================================

@created: Sun Aug 23 18:30:28     2009
@status: draft
@target: 5.7.5
@category: unittest

Scope of Change
---------------
At the moment, there are three possible outcomes of a unittest: Succeeded,
Skipped and Failed. This RFC suggests adding more kinds of outcomes: 
Error and NotRun.


Rationale
---------
Be able to distinguish between the different non-success reasons.


Functionality
-------------
The new outcomes are represented by these new classes:

<code>
  class TestError extends TestFailure {
    // ...
  }
  
  class TestNotRun extends TestSkipped {
    // ...
  }
</code>

Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~
<summary>
These current outcomes are defined:
* "." - Succeeded (Test was successful)
* "S" - Skipped (Test was skipped by either an error inside setUp() or by
  an @ignore annotation)
* "F" - Failed (Test failed due to an assertion error, an expected exception
  not being caught or by an exception raised by the code inside).

Example output:
<pre>
  [..SSFFF]
  2 succeeded, 2 skipped, 3 failed
</pre>
</summary>

<summary>
This RFC suggests to add the following new outcomes:
* "E" - Exception (An exception other than AssertionFailedError was thrown when
  executing the test and no @expected annotation existed)
* "N" - Not run (Test was ignored by @ignore, as stated above, this is currently 
  also reported as "skipped")

Example output:
<pre>
  [..SNFFE]
  2 succeeded, 2 skipped, 3 failed
</pre>
</summary>
