Scope of Change
---------------
At the moment, there are three possible outcomes of a unittest: Succeeded,
Skipped and Failed. This RFC suggests adding more kinds of outcomes: 
Ignored, Timedout and Exception.


Rationale
---------
Be able to distinguish between the different non-success reasons.


Functionality
-------------

Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~
<summary>
These current outcomes are defined:
* Succeeded (Test was successful)
* Skipped (Test was skipped by either an error inside setUp() or by
  an @ignore annotation)
* Failed (Test failed due to an assertion error, an expected exception
  not being caught or by an exception raised by the code inside).

Example output:
<pre>
  [..SSFFF]
  2 succeeded, 2 skipped, 3 failed
</pre>
</summary>

<summary>
This RFC suggests to add the following new outcomes:
* Ignored (Test was ignored by @ignore, as stated above, this is currently 
  also reported as "skipped")
* TimedOut (Test exceeded the time limit given in @limit, at the moment 
  this is reported as "failed")
* Exception (An exception other than AssertionFailedError was thrown when
  executing the test and no @expected annotation existed)

Example output:
<pre>
  [..SIFTE]
  2 succeeded, 1 skipped, 1 ignored, 3 failed
</pre>
</summary>
