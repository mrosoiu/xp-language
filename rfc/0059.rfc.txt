@status: implemented
@category: util.profiling.unittest

Scope of Change
---------------
A timeout facility will be added to unit tests. When a test runs longer
than the time span defined by the timeout facility, the test will be 
marked as timeouted.


Rationale
---------
Integration tests that test certain system parts such as an LDAP server
might want to test not only that accessing the server works but also 
that a query succeeds in a certain time.


Functionality
-------------
A test can be annotated with the @limit annotation as follows:

<?php
  class LdapIntegrationTest extends TestCase {
  
    #[@test, @limit(time= 1.0)]
    function lookup() {
      // ...
    }
  }
?>

Test failure message:
<code>
  util.profiling.unittest.AssertionFailedError (Timeout) { 
    expected: ["0.100"] but was: ["0.201"] 
  }
</code>

Security considerations

Speed impact
------------
Minimal overhead for checking the existance of the @limit annotation.


Dependencies

- RFC #0032 - This is where the annotation was originally suggested,
  but later on decided not to be implemented (see comments). It had
  a different meaning there, though.

  Maybe for timeout we should not have TestFailure as result but
  TestTimeout to be able to distinguish?

  Based on discussion with the PHP-Dev team and Frank Kleine of 
  Schlund+Partner, we decided to name the annotation @limit which
  is a more generic name for this and may be enhanced in the future
  to support @limit(memory= ...) etc.
