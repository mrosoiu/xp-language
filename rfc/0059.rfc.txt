@category: util.profiling.unittest

Scope of Change
---------------
A timeout facility will be added to unit tests. When a test runs longer
than the time span defined by the timeout facility, the test will be 
marked as timeouted.


Rationale
---------
Integration tests that test certain system parts such as an LDAP server
might want to test not only that accessing the server works but also 
that a query succeeds in a certain time.


Functionality
-------------
A test can be annotated with the @timeout annotation as follows:

<?php
  class LdapIntegrationTest extends TestCase {
  
    #[@test, @timeout(1.0)]
    function lookup() {
      // ...
    }
  }
?>

Test failure message:
<code>
  util.profiling.unittest.AssertionFailedError (Timeout) { 
    expected: ["0.100"] but was: ["0.201"] 
  }
</code>

Security considerations

Speed impact
------------
Minimal overhead for checking the existance of the @timeout annotation.


Dependencies

Related documents
-----------------
- RFC #0032 - This is where the annotation was originally suggested,
  but later on decided not to be implemented (see comments). It had
  a different meaning there, though.

- http://xp-framework.net/downloads/rfc0059.diff
  Patch implementing this RFC. Also contains some refactoring which
  could go into the util.profiling.unittest classes regardless if
  this RFC is implemented or not (TestCase::run() now is where the
  action is, TestSuite::runTest() only calls it...).

- http://xp-framework.net/downloads/rfc0059-demotest-patch.diff
  Patch for net.xp_framework.unittest.DemoTest. The author is fully
  aware of the existance of the usleep() function but uses Windows
  at home:)
