Scope of Change
---------------
The XP framework use the PHP function parse_url() in several classes to
get the different parts of an URI. This URI can include a username and
password part to for specifing access data to special resource. Problem
is, that the username or password can have special chars (like %) which
has to be encoded in the URI string to make it "binary safe".

Rationale
---------
Usernames or passwords with special characters will not work correctly.
E.g. passwords using "@" sign doesn't work at the moment because
parse_url() assumes everything after "@" sign as host name.

Example:
<?php
  var_dump(parse_url('ftp://username:passwordwith@sign@hostname/'));
?>

This example will output the following array:
<pre>
array(5) {
  ["scheme"]=>
  string(3) "ftp"
  ["host"]=>
  string(13) "sign@hostname"
  ["user"]=>
  string(8) "username"
  ["pass"]=>
  string(12) "passwordwith"
  ["path"]=>
  string(1) "/"
}
</pre>

Functionality
-------------
Instead of parse_url() the URL class should be used. This URL class has
to be changed to support special characters in username or password
strings which means that the username and password strings has to be
decoded using PHP's rawurldecode() function.
Further each URI string passed to URL class constructor has to encode
the username and password using rawurlencode() to make it "binary safe".

The following list contains all classes which use parse_url() currently:
<pre>
- peer/mail/transport/SmtpTransport.class.php
- peer/mail/store/CclientStore.class.php
- peer/ftp/FtpConnection.class.php
- peer/URL.class.php
- rdbms/DSN.class.php
- scriptlet/HttpScriptlet.class.php
- scriptlet/HttpScriptletRequest.class.php
- text/apidoc/Reference.class.php
</pre>

Security considerations
-----------------------
(n/a)

Speed impact
------------
URL class has to be included in the classes using parse_url() which will
slight increase the speed of parsing/compiling the source code.

  Should we really use URL in each class using parse_url()?
