Scope of Change
---------------
In case the same PHP error occurs multiple times, it will no longer be 
added to the error registry on each occurence. Instead, a counter will 
keep track how many times this error has occured.


Rationale
---------
Prevent running out of memory in a situation where a loop is causing
an error in each of its iterations.


Functionality
-------------

Take the following script:
<?php
  for ($i= 0; $i < 1000; $i++) {
    $a.= '';    // E_NOTICE: Undefined variable:  a
    unset($a);
  }
?>

At the moment of writing this RFC, this will cause 1000 new elements to
be added to the xp error registry. When the changes this RFC suggests
are implemented, this will result in 1 element being added to the error
registry and its occurrence counter being equal to 1000.


Security considerations

Speed impact
------------
- Possible slight decrease in error handler

But:
- Memory footprint decrease in error handler at the same time

- Performance increase in xp::errorAt() for the case file *and* line
  number are passed in

- Performance increase in lang.StackTraceElement's toString() method

Over all, this should be slightly faster for the general case.


Dependencies
------------
This introduces a small BC break in lang.StackTraceElement: The member
$messages (an array) is replaced by a member $message (a string).
