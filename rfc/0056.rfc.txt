Scope of Change
---------------
Change all known RPC apis to be based on a common structure.

Rationale
---------
All apis are influenced by each other, all looking pretty similar, 
with some differences only in details related to the underlying 
protocol.

With a common base hierarchy, all apis could be shrinked, only protocol 
specifics would remain. This would make developing new apis easier and
remove "code duplication" code smell.

Functionality
-------------
A base package scriptlet.rpc would be introduced, containing the
following classes:
 * class AbstractRpcRouter
 * class AbstractRpcRequest
 * class AbstractRpcResponse
 * interface AbstractRpcMessage

APIs to migrate to this new base are:
 * xml.soap.rpc
 * xml.xmlrpc.rpc
 * org.json.rpc (does not yet exist)

  We should probably begin creating this API when creating the new
  JsonRpc package.
