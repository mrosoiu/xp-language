Scope of Change
---------------
XML related and XSL related classes include support to construct a
DOM tree.

Rationale
---------
PHPs way to handle XML documents is the DOM API. While the XP Framework
encapsulates XML access, XML documents must be converted to something PHP
understands to process it.

At the moment, the XML in memory is converted into an XML string to be
passed to PHP. PHP then parses the XML into a DOM document and processes
it.

These two steps can be folded into one, when XP supports creating a
DOMDocument object from its xml.Tree and xml.Node objects. This saves
both space and processing time.

Functionality
-------------
xml.Tree can be converted into a DOMDocument with its getDomTree() method
that internally uses xml.Node::getDomNode() and other interacting classes
getDomNode() method.

xml.DomXSLProcessor can take a DOMDocument both as XSL template document
or XML document and perform its translation on that.

Security considerations
-----------------------

Speed impact
------------
A speed increase is expected.

  Synthetic and - more interesting - real-world tests have shown that this
  method would be slower(!) than using the current approach(!)
