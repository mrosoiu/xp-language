Scope of Change
---------------
An EASC server implementation will be written in userland PHP.


Rationale
---------
Testing.


Functionality
-------------

Featureset
~~~~~~~~~~
The following features will be included in the first release:
<pre>
  * EJB3-style stateless session beans
  * Hot deployment
</pre>

The following features will not be included in the basic version:
<pre>
  * Authentication and protection
  * Resource management (rbms connections)
  * Other bean types
  * Messaging
  * Transactions
  * AOP / Interceptors
</pre>


Beans
~~~~~
Beans - that is: classes following a certain standard in order to be
recognized by the application server as services - are plain XP classes
(meaning they extend lang.Object) decorated with annotations.

The following rules apply:
<pre>
* The class annotation @bean denotes this class is a bean class.
* Any method that should be invokeable via remote method invocation
  is decorated with the @remote annotation
</pre>

Example:
<?php
  #[@bean(type= STATELESS, name= 'xp/demo/Roundtrip')]
  class RoundtripBean extends Object {
  
    #[@remote]
    function echoString($str) {
      return $str;
    }
  }
?>


Packaging
~~~~~~~~~
In order to deploy beans they will have to packaged by a packaging tool.
This tool creates a XAR (XP Application Archive) which can then be
deployed in the server.


Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~
The server will support deployment by means of copying the XAR packages 
to a "deploy" directory, which the server monitors by scanning for new
or touched files periodically, deploying as needed.
