Scope of Change
---------------
Since RFC #0104 xml.DomXSLProcessor supports PHP callbacks from
within an XSL transformation.

Default callbacks which will be always available will be added
to provide some basic callbacks.

Rationale
---------
Eg. string- and date-based operations and calculations cannot be
easily handled in XSL code; until now, programmers usually work
around that problem by appending pre-generated values into the
XML tree which bloat the data.

Functionality
-------------
Some standard functions will be provided by classes in the
to be introduced xml.xslt package.

The symbolic instance names will be in the "namespace" xp. The
string handling class registers as "xp.string", the date handling
class as "xp.date".

Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a

Speed impact
------------
Slightly slower, as two more classes will need to be loaded each
time DomXSLProcessor is in use.

Dependencies
------------
