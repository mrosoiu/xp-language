@category: <infrastructure>

Scope of Change
---------------
As with the "unittest" command, the xpcli-Runner will also accept 
filenames as class names.


Rationale
---------
* Use of tab-completion
* Consistency with "unittest"


Functionality
-------------
The util.cmd.Runner class will check for the first argument containing
the string ".class.php" (or actually, whatever xp::CLASS_FILE_EXT 
constant is defined for), and then try to find the class in the classpath.

To run a Command class, you can use the following:
<pre>
  # Use class name
  $ xpcli fully.qualified.ClassName

  # Use filename
  $ xpcli fully/qualified/ClassName.class.php
</pre>

Note
~~~~
Using filenames only works if classes are found in the classpath, 
otherwise there is no way to infer the classname from the file's name!


Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a


Speed impact
------------
- Slightly slower: One strstr() check for ".class.php" for every case


Dependencies
------------
n/a

  Implementing patch also contains a couple of bugfixes:
  * Markup from method apidocs not correctly textified 
  * Duplicate @args-check removal
  * Positional args numbering off by one in error message
  * @args selection not respected in error message
