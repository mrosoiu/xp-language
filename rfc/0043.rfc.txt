Scope of Change
---------------
A new class called remote.UnknownRemoteObject will be added. In case the
deserializer detects a class that is unknown an object of this class will
be constructed instead of throwing a lang.ClassNotFoundException.


Rationale
---------
This procedure will ease rapid prototyping of EASC service clients.


Functionality
-------------
The UnknownRemoteObject is an overloaded class that can only be displayed
(via its toString() method) but not programmatically accessed. Any member
access or method invocation will cause an IllegalAccessException to be
thrown.


Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a


Speed impact
------------
For the case that a class cannot be found by the deserializer, a 
ClassNotFoundException will be caught and the UnknownRemoteObject will
be constructed. In this case, of course, it makes everything slower.
This should only occur during development, though.


Dependencies
------------
overload extension
