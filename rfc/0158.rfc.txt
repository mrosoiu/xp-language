Scope of Change
---------------
Register instances of scriptlet objects whereever available to 
provide a standard basis for applications where to put XSL 
callback methods.

Rationale
---------
XSL callbacks should be used where implementing in XSL is re-
implementation of thing already available in XP or just to
difficult to implement.
A standard way of providing these callbacks need to be provided
as access to the XSL processor is required to register a callback
and that access is not given at all places.

Functionality
-------------
A scriptlet instance will be registered as 'active.scriptlet'
where a scriptlet.xml.XMLScriptlet-derived scriplet class is used.

A state instance will be registered as 'active.state' where a 
state is instanciated and used for the request.

A context instance will be registered as 'active.context' where a
context is available.

  Should handlers also be registered? If yes, only active ones?
  If yes, what should be the naming strategy for the callback?

  What scriptlet methods would you use from active.scriptlet?

  We need some use-cases here!
