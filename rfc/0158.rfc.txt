Scope of Change
---------------
Register instances of scriptlet API objects whereever available to 
provide a standard basis for applications where to put XSL 
callback methods.

Rationale
---------
XSL callbacks should be used where implementing in XSL is re-
implementation of thing already available in XP or just to
difficult to implement in plain XSL.
A standard way of providing these callbacks need to be provided
as access to the XSL processor is required to register a callback
and that access is not given at all places.

Functionality
-------------
A state instance will be registered as 'active.state' where a 
state is instanciated and used for the request.

A context instance will be registered as 'active.context' where a
context is available.

Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a

Speed impact
------------
Because we'll have a few more function calls, overall code will be
slower, but neglectible. For applications actually using these callbacks,
there will be impact on performance to the extent that XSL callbacks
usually do.

Dependencies
------------
n/a

  Should handlers also be registered? If yes, only active ones?
  If yes, what should be the naming strategy for the callback?

  What scriptlet methods would you use from active.scriptlet?

  We need some use-cases here!

  Adjusted due to "recent" concerns.

  Rejected, seems not to be needed.
