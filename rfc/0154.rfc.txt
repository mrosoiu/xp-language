Scope of Change
---------------
Scriptlets will be instanciated in a well-defined, standard way, controlled
by environment settings. The "index.php" file will become standardized 
and look the same in every installation.
Debug flags can also be set to change logging and verbosity of the 
application.

Rationale
---------
Several aspects exist:
* Logging / debugging
  People often forget to remove debugging flags, which need to be passed to
  the scriptlet running sapi. Applications are committed with debug enabled,
  which should not happen for production environments.
  Now logging can be turned on or off globally for a development machine
  and turned on or off for production machines, either globally or per-vhost.

* Unifying the web-applications startup
  XP applications need a defined layout for applications, given by conventions
  defined in this RFC.
  With conventions on the layout of web-applications, startup can be auto-
  matized and made by classes which then can be reused in other environments,
  as eg. within a self-running archive.

* index.php should only contain boilterplate code
  This ensures all web-applications use scriptlet technologies and they
  all use it the same way.
