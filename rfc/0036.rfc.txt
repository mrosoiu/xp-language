========================================================================

@category: <core>

Scope of Change
---------------
Add the timezone offset against GMT to the util.Date class.

Rationale
---------
This is required to be able to calculate the GMT representation 
from a given date object. This information is required to properly
calculate time differences between date objects in different time-
zones.

Functionality
-------------
A new member $tz will be added to the util.Date class that contains
the offset of the timezone of the date object against GMT in seconds.
Negative offsets indicate timezones west of GMT, positive ones indicate
timezones east of GMT.

If constructing a date object without explicitely defining a timezone,
the hosts default timezone will be used.

Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a

Speed impact
------------
This change adds a member variable and various getters and setters to the
util.Date class, which is a core class. This change will decrease speed and
increase the classes memory footprint. Speed deterioration should not be
measureable; the additional memory required is an acceptable trade-off.

Dependencies

  rdbms systems like Sybase ASE and MySQL (and probably others) do not store
  any timezone information with their date types. This is usually handled by
  assigning the database a timezone which is then known to all systems accessing
  that database.
  To be able to correctly extract a date column from a database, we might need
  to supply this information to the rdbms.DBConnection-derived classes. This
  could happen by extending the DSN format and add a new parameter. Example:
  "sybase://wurst:brot@SERVER/database?autoconnect=1&defaulttz=CET

  LDAP servers do store timezone information, the peer.ldap package thus is
  only slightly affected by this change.

  Should util.TimeZone become part of <core>?
