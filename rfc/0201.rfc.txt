RFC 0201: XP Overlays

Scope of Change
---------------
Path files will support prepending elements to the class path via special
syntax. 


Rationale
---------
Sometimes it's necessary to overwrite certain parts of the XP framework's
classes (the ones distributed in xp-rt xar files). One of the usecases is
to keep using deprecated APIs in conjunction with a release in which they
were removed, but being able to use new APIs provided with this release
in other parts of the program. Another example is the ability to production-
test new functionality (e.g., from SVN head, or even from the experiments
in xp forge) together with the latest release.


Functionality
-------------
Lines in path files starting with an exclamation mark will be prepended
to the class path rather than being appended, which is the default mode
of operations.

Example (~/projects/hub/class.pth)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<pre>
  !lib/ftp-bc-2010-04-30.xar
  src
  lib/sqlproxy-1.0.16.xar
</pre>

Assuming an XP release from /opt/xp/lib is used, this would lead to the 
following class path:

<pre>
  ~/projects/hub/lib/ftp-bc-2010-04-30.xar
  /opt/xp/lib/5.7.8/
  /opt/xp/lib/5.7.8/xp-rt-5.7.8.xar
  /opt/xp/lib/5.7.8/xp-tools-5.7.8.xar
  ~/projects/hub/src
  ~/projects/hub/lib/sqlproxy-1.0.16.xar
</pre>


Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a


Speed impact
------------
The class loading mechanism searches for classes and resources in the 
order of appearance in the class path, that is, even if only small parts
of the XP Framework are overwritten, the prepended elements are asked
for all XP Framework classes, including "Object" and others. That's why
overlaying the XP Framework will make the class loading process slower,
depending on the size of the overlay.


Dependencies
------------
If relative path names starting with an exclamation mark were used in
path files, they must now be written as <tt>./!path</tt>. Path entries
containg the exclamation mark at the end or anywhere inbetween do not 
need to be changed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We generally continue to support deprecated features at least for one 
year - and will always announce deprecation in the "Heads up!" section 
in the ChangeLog. Instead of continuing the use deprecated APIs the XP 
team suggests to migrate to the new API, but we also recognize their
might be situations in which this is not possible.
