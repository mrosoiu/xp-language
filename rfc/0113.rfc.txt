Scope of Change
---------------
To make XP's SOAP implementation co-exist with the PHP5 SOAP extension,
the following classes must be renamed:
  . webservices.soap.SoapHeader
  . webservices.soap.SoapClient
  
as they clash with classes brought in by the extension (which we cannot
change).

*Update*

The following classes have been moved:

webservices.soap.SOAPHeaderElement.class.php
webservices.soap.SOAPMapping.class.php      
webservices.soap.SOAPNode.class.php         
webservices.soap.SOAPHeader.class.php     
webservices.soap.XPSoapClient.class.php     

Now their FQCN looks like this:

webservices.soap.xp.SOAPHeaderElement.class.php
webservices.soap.xp.SOAPMapping.class.php      
webservices.soap.xp.SOAPNode.class.php         
webservices.soap.xp.XPSOAPHeader.class.php     
webservices.soap.xp.XPSoapClient.class.php

It's probably a good idea to rename XPSOAPHeaderElement for more consitency.

Rationale
---------
XP provides its own SOAP support which is enterprise-proven, but is not 
a feature-complete SOAP implementation. Furthermore, it makes use of 
class names that PHP5 ext/soap also uses. You must not compile PHP with 
SOAP and use XP SOAP with the same PHP installation.

Despite of that, it'd be a good addition to provide an interface to let
the programmer decide which SOAP implementation he wants to use as the
back-end without having to care about the decision in what he does.

Functionality
-------------
In the first step - to clear the way - the above mentioned classes will
be prefixed with XP.

Second, the SOAP API will follow the Factory Pattern, so new clients will
not be constructed directly, but instanciated through a factory, or a driver
manager similar to what the XP framework offers in the rdbms package.

Third, it has become a common practice to derive particular SOAP clients
from class SOAPClient when generating or writing the client class. Due to 
the changes mentioned before, this is not possible any more then, because
the derivation will bind the class to a certain SOAP implementation.
Instead, clients should become simple objects with a $client member that
gets inserted on object instantiation through the factory.

I introduced a new class called SoapDriver as a test. The usage is pretty 
straight forward.

*Update*

For example:
SoapDriver::getInstance()->fromEndpoint(http://somesoapservice/is/here/, 
  'urn:someSoapMethod');

This will create an instance of the SoapDriver using the XPSoapClient (which
is the default driver). The Soapcall itself hasn't changed:
->invoke($method, $vars).

The method "selectDriver($driver)" will let you change to a different Soap-
Driver (Right now,SOAPNATIVE and SOAPXP are supported).

You can also use WSDL-Mode:

SoapDriver::getInstance()->fromWsdl(http://somesoapservice/is/here/, 
'urn:someSoapMethod');

WSDL is only supported by the PHP5-soap-extension and _not by the XPSoapClient.

  Should the SoapClient receive an URL as first parameter instead of a
  SOAPHTTPTransport in the future? Not like there was ever a need for a
  different transport that that.
