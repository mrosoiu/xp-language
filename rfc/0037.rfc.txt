RFC 0037: Ability to fully qualify class names
========================================================================
$Id$

@authors: friebe
@created: Fri Sep  2 18:00:18 CEST 2005
@status: draft
@category: <core>

Scope of Change
---------------
Classes can be optionally declared with their fully qualified name. Class 
loading and reflection semantics will not change, though.

Rationale
---------
Avoid name clashes.

Functionality
-------------
A new "keyword" "package" is introduced. It declares a class a being 
within a package and thus declared using its fully qualified name.

Example
~~~~~~~
<?php
  uses('util.Date');

  package('info.binford6100');

  class info·binford6100·Date extends Date {
  
    function toString() {
      return 'More Power: '.parent::toString();
    }
  }
?>

Notes
~~~~~
<pre>
- For existing classes, nothing will change

- Fully qualified classes can only be referenced by their fully qualified
  name, non-fully-qualified classes can only be referenced by their non-
  qualified name
</pre>

Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a

Speed impact
------------
Core will become a bit slower because it will need to distinguish between
the two cases:

1) A class is declared with its fully qualified name
2) A class is declared non-fully qualified

Dependencies
------------
A new keyword "package".
