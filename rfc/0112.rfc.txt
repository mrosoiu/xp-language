Scope of Change
---------------
The HttpScriptletException will inherit from util.ChainedException.

Rationale
---------
It is difficult to debug scriptlets in case of exceptions, because
the handleProcess() method in scriptlet.HttpScriptlet catches all
exceptions and re-throws them as HttpScriptletExceptions.
While that may be a good thing, the backdraw is the loss of the
original stacktrace, making error search more difficult.

Functionality
-------------
scriptlet.HttpScriptletException will inherit util.ChainedException
which can take a causing exception as constructor argument. The
original exception - and with it its stacktrace - will be preserved
for later inspection.

Security considerations
-----------------------
In production systems, stacktraces may not be visible. By using the
sapis scriptlet.production, one can suppress the printing of all
stacktrace information (usually, only the message of the exception
is shown then).

Speed impact
