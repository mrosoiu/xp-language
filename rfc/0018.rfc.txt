RFC 0018: Serial in formresult without time zone
========================================================================

@category: scriptlet.xml.OutputDocument

Scope of Change
---------------
The scriptlet response XML tree contains a "serial" attribute in
top level "formresult" node which contains the current timestamp. To
make some calculation with this serial we need the time zone too which
is currently missing there.

Rationale
---------
Some applications want to do some calculations with the @serial. To make
them really work we need to have the time zone available too.

Functionality
-------------
Actually the XML response string looks like this:
<pre>
  <formresult
    serial="1108993160"
    xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  >
    <formvalues>
      ...
    </formvalue>
    ...
  </formresult>
</pre>

To be able to do some calculations with this @serial we have to add the
time zone too. Example would look like this:
<pre>
  <formresult
    serial="1108993160"
    tz="3600"
    xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  >
    <formvalues>
      ...
    </formvalue>
    ...
  </formresult>
</pre>

The formresult gets a new attribute "tz" which contains the time zone
specification in seconds (e.g. the value "3600" equivalent to the time
zone "+0100" - the result of PHP function date('Z')).

Due to the fact, that the time zone information will be stored in a new
attribute this is not a BC break.

Dependencies
------------
None.

  I guess we can just implement this way by adding a new attribute
  containing the time zone specification in seconds.

  By this, we would finally declare @serial as the timestamp at the
  time of execution of the script. This was used like that before but
  never reliably defined.
