@status: draft
@target: 5.9.0
@category: <core>

Scope of Change
---------------
The "sapi" feature will be dropped from the XP framework completely.

Rationale
---------
The sapi feature was initially introduced to offer a way to extend the
XP framework's core code, provided by "lang.base.php", in a manner similar
to that file, eg. without having to encapsulate that code in a class.

Now, we think code should always be loaded as a class, which bring several
features like having an associated classloader.

Functionality
-------------
Functionality provided by one of the XP framework's sapi files will be
migrated to be provided by regular classes, preferrably backwards compatible.

Currently available sapis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* cgi
  The cgi sapi will be migrated so its functionality is provided by the
  scriptlet API, if required.

* cli
  The cli sapi will be provided by the `xp` and `xpcli` executors.
  
* class
  The class sapi has been deprecated by the `xpcli` executor and will be
  dropped.

* synchronized
  This sapi will be dropped, as there is no program reported to use it.

* strict
  Functionality of the "strict" sapi has been incorporated in standard
  XP unittest, by checking for an "unclean error stack". This sapi will
  therefore be dropped.
