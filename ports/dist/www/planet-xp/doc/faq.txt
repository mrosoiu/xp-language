Q: Realnames from blogs aren't available in the feed, how can I display 
them nonetheless?
   
A: Many feeds don't offer realname information. We circumvent this short-
come by having this information available in the database.

There are two possibilites to make supply this information:
a) The feed only contains one person writing articles: we can store the
   author's name in feed.author and it will be displayed as realname
   for every article in the feed.

b) Multiple authors write in a feed:
   This requires that some kind of author information is returned in the
   feed. Mostly - however - this is no realname. But we can use it to
   map it to a realname. In table authormapping store the feed's id and the
   string, the feed returns as author.
   
   For example, blog.xp-framework.net returns 'alex@kiesel.name (kiesel)'
   for articles written by me. With
   
   insert into authormapping values (1, 'alex@kiesel.name (kiesel)', 'Alex Kiesel')
   
   this will be corrected for this author in this blog (the feed's id is 1).



Q: Some feed do not supply publishing dates. What date is used, then?

A: This is really annoying. Currently, it's handled the way that new entries
are stored with the current timestamp. Dates aren't updated when an existing
entry is re-synced - the original date is being preserved.

When updateing often enough, this isn't a problem. It has the shortcoming that
when syndicating a blog for the first time, all it's entries will be the most
recent ones. Manual update is required for the first time, then.



Q: What RSS feeds are supported?

A: It depends on xml.rdf.RDFNewsFeed - feeds it understand are understood by
planet-xp. The parser parses RDF and (in contrary to it's name) RSS feeds. It is
no validating parser, so it just does what it can. You could even mix RDF and
RSS elements and it would do the job.

For the data being present in the feeds, it seems RSS2.0 is the most complete
format - it has everything we need. One example RSS2.0 feed can be seen at 
http://blog.xp-framework.net/rss.php?version=2.0

Atom is not supported.



Q: How to add a new feed?
A: See tools/addfeed.php. You can run it with
php tools/addfeed --url=http://blog.xp-framework.net/rss.php?version=2.0 --syndicate=1

After this, it'll be picked up by the bin/syndicate.php cron and be syndicated. You
can run this manually, too.
