Dialog: Importing an Album
========================================================================
$Id$

Importing an album into dialog can be accomplished in the following ways:

By shell script
---------------
The bin/ subdirectory contains an import script called import.php. It 
will import a complete directory of (original) images. It assumes the 
following directory layout:

<pre>
  + [directory]
  |--+ [highlights]
  |  |-- image #1
  |  |-- image #2
  |  |-- ...
  |
  |-- description.txt
  |-- image #1
  |-- image #2
  |-- ...
</pre>

It will then follow these rules:

* The images from the "highlights" subdirectory will be taken for
  the images on the front page. They will be rescaled to 150 x 113
  pixels for this purpose.
  
  If no such directory exists, the script will pick at most 4 images
  from the entire directory's contents per random.

* The entire text from the file description.txt will be used to
  make the text for the front page.
  Note: This can be overridden by a command line switch.
  
* The directory's name will be used for the album's title.
  Note: This can be overridden by a command line switch.

* The directory's creation date will be used for the album's 
  creation timestamp.
  Note: This can be overridden by a command line switch.

* The images from the directory (file mask: *.JPG) will be taken
  for the images on the subsequent pages. They will be resized to
  150 x 113 pixels for the overview and to 640 x 480 or 480 x 640
  pixels (depending on the picture's orientation) for the larger
  view.

* The directory's name will be transformed to the album's online
  name by lowercasing all characters in it and replacing any 
  character besides a-z, 0-9 and - by an underscore. Double 
  underscores will be replaced by single ones.
  
  Example: 
    "Steve's birthday 02/28/2005" will become
    "steves_birthday_02_28_2005"

  The online name is used in permalinks.
