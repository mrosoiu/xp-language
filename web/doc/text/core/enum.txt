Type-safe enumerations
======================
Often there is the necessity to define functionality based on a set of
values. If you have experience in C, you may have seen <tt>typedef enum {
WHITE, BLACK, YELLOW } color_t;</tt> before. In PHP, one could write 
something like <tt>define('WHITE', 0);</tt> and <tt>define('BLACK', 1);</tt>
which is pretty much what the C version does. The problem with these approaches
are that they are not type-safe, and functionality needs to be attached by
using <tt>switch</tt> or <tt>if-else</tt> cascades.
