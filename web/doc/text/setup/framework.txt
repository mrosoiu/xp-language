Setting up the framework
========================
The releases are offered as <tt>tar.gz</tt> or <tt>zip</tt> files which 
contain lang.base.php and the xp runtime.

<summary>
Prerequisite: You need to download and install the 
[http://de3.php.net/ PHP language] to use the XP framework. PHP version 
>= 5.2.0 is required.
</summary>


Step by step
------------
Follow these steps to install the framework on your workstation:

Download
~~~~~~~~
Get the zipfile or tar.gz, whatever you're more comfortable with and save 
it to your disk.

Unpack
~~~~~~
Create a directory (e.g. xp) - doesn't matter where - and extract the 
archive's contents into it. This will create <tt>lang.base.php</tt> and 
<tt>lib/xp-rt-X.X.X.xar</tt>

Configure PHP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open the <tt>php.ini</tt> file and search for a line containing <tt>include_path</tt>.
Add the directory you unpacked the XP framework release and the <tt>xp-rt-X.X.X.xar</tt>
to this line.

<summary>
<ul>
  <li>Un*x: <tt>include_path=".:/home/thekid/xp/:/home/thekid/xp/lib/xp-rt-5.0.0.xar"</tt></li>
  <li>Windows: <tt>include_path=".;D:\var\xp\;D:\var\xp\lib\xp-rt-5.0.0.xar".</tt></li>
</ul>
</summary>

Done
~~~~
You're ready to use the XP framework now!


Using additional packages
-------------------------
Additional packages (Google Search implementation, Delicio.us, Flickr, 
Java Webstart, Dia.org UML classes, and many more) are provided in the 
lib directory and must be downloaded separately.

Download
~~~~~~~~
Download the xar files from the releases' lib directory into the same 
directory where <tt>xp-rt-X.X.X.xar</tt> resides.

Configure PHP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add the downloaded file to the include_path as described above.

Done
~~~~
The package is now available and can be used.
