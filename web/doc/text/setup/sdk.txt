To develop with the XP framework here's an overview of the essential utilities:

The xp utility
--------------
Runs XP classes with a <tt>main</tt> method and is the base for all other
utilities.

Usage
~~~~~
Given the following class:
<code>
  uses('util.cmd.Console');
  
  class SayHello extends Object {
  
    public static function main(array $args) {
      Console::writeLine('Hello ', $args[0]);
    }
  }
</code>

...the following run on a command line:
<pre>
  $ xp SayHello World 
</pre>
...will print "Hello World" to the console.

The xpcli utility
-----------------
Runs [package://util.cmd command line classes], which greatly simplify the
task of writing command line utilities. Instead of having to parse arguments, 
instantiate database connections and load configuration files manually, 
command line classes can ask for these resources by annotating methods.

The following is the (functional) equivalent of the above:
<code>
  uses('util.cmd.Command');
  
  class SayHello extends Command {
    protected $name;
    
    #[@arg(position= 0)]
    public function setName($name) {
      $this->name= $name;
    }
  
    public function run() {
      $this->out->writeLine('Hello ', $this->name);
    }
  }
</code>

To print "Hello World" to the console:
<pre>
  $ xpcli SayHello World 
</pre>

This method may look like additional overhead in the beginning (and actually
is in this case) but has numerous benefits - [http://news.xp-framework.net/article/205/2007/07/22/ this entry] 
from our blog explains "xpclis" in depth.


The unittest utility
--------------------
Runs [package://unittest unittests].

The xar utility
---------------
Works with [doc://core/xars XAR archives].
