Introduction to RFCs
====================
RFC stands for Request For Comments, but you knew that:)

Why do we have RFCs?
--------------------
One of the major deficiencies in the development of many projects is that 
there is no roadmap or strategy available other than in the developers' heads. 
Changes are made and then discussed, not the other way around. That's the 
way it usually works: Decisions are made by the developers, who assume they
always know what is good and what is not. Userland developers (that is, people
using projects and not developing the projects themselves) do not participate 
in this discussion (or rarely do) nor would it make any difference as their 
vote only counts if they are "hardcore developers".

In contrary, Sun has JSRs (Java Specification Requests) at http://jcp.org/.
This way, userland developers can follow the development of Java or even
decide to discuss it. The process is transparent (JSRs are publicly
downloadable) and creates a touch of professionalism, something developers
(and, maybe even more important for the reputation of a language: CTOs) will
definitely be impressed of. JSRs are also used to describe new language
features such as the ones introduced in JDK 1.5 (Metadata, Enums, Generics,
... I've pointed you to that before).

Microsoft also has specifications available, for example here:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/team/language/default.aspx for C# 2.0
(draft), Python has so-called PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals) at
http://www.python.org/peps/

When is an RFC needed?
----------------------
An RFC is needed when changes are made that affect one of the following:

* Core functionality in lang.base.php
* Classes in lang and util
* Wherever it affects a lot of places, e.g. xml.Node
* When BC (backwards compatibility) is broken
* New packages

Who can write RFCs?
-------------------
Short answer: Anybody. 

* People with accounts may commit them directly to SVN (in the rfc/ 
  top-level directory).
* Users without SVN accounts should send an email with the RFC attached 
  to the XP framework's mailinglist.
