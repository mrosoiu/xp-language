SVN checkout
============
The XP framework's sourcecode is maintained in a [http://subversion.tigris.org/ subversion]
(SVN) repository.

Anonymous
---------
Anyone can check out the sourcecode! To check out the XP framework's sources 
into a directory named <tt>xp</tt> in the current working directory, use the 
following command:

<pre>
  $ svn co svn://xp-framework.net/xp/trunk xp
</pre>

This will not require credentials but will also be a *read-only* checkout.

Developer
---------
If you have a developer account and would like to be able to commit to the
XP framework's sources, you need to use the following command:

<pre>
  $ svn co svn+ssh://{USER}@developer.xp-framework.net/home/svn/xp/trunk xp
</pre>
