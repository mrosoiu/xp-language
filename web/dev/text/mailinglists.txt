Mailinglist for XP-developers
=============================
We offer an unmoderated list for developers, a list for commit messages 
and one bug list where all bug mail out of our Bugzilla are sent to.

Subscribing
-----------
We use <tt>ezmlm</tt>, so to subscribe just send an email to 
<tt>xp-subscribe@xp-framework.net</tt>. You will be replied and then need to 
confirm your subscription by answering that mail.
If you need help with ezmlm, just send an empty message to
<tt>xp-help@xp-framework.net</tt>.

The same method - appending '-subscribe' after the list's name applies
to our other lists, as well; these are <tt>xp-svn@xp-framework.net</tt> for 
commits and <tt>xp-bugs@xp-framework.net</tt> for the bug activity.

Posting to the lists generally require subscription due to SPAM issues.

Charta, etiquette
-----------------
The mailinglist is used to discuss anything that has to do with the 
XP framework. That includes:
<ul>
  <li>Commits</li>
  <li>Blog entries</li>
  <li>Release plans</li>
  <li>RFCs</li>
  <li>Questions about the framework that are not covered
      in our online documentation.</li>
</ul>
