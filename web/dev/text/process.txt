The RFC process
===============
The workflow is as follows (reflected in all states into the @status
attribute):

Explanation
-----------
* An RFC is always created in the status "draft".
* When the authors decide they are content with it so far, the status
  is changed to "discussion". During this phase, the core developers
  will discuss the RFC with the authors. Anybody may join this 
  discussion. The RFC may be changed during this time in agreement 
  with the people involved.
* An RFC can be deferred, meaning that nobody is working on the draft
  and no decision has been found in the discussion phase. A deferred
  RFC may be reset to draft status in case work should start again.
* An RFC can be rejected, either directly after the draft state or
  during the discussion.
* An RFC can be obsoleted during its draft or discussion state, meaning 
  it is no longer needed. In this case, a new RFC replaces this RFC.
* After an RFC has been discussed and not rejected or deferred, its
  status goes to "accepted" if it cannot be immediately implemented.
* After the RFC has been implemented and the necessary files committed,
  its status goes to "implemented".
