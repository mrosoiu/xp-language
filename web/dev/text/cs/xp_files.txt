Coding standards: Framework: File layout
========================================

The comment at the top of a file should contain the Id-Tag, that is at least
<tt>$Id$</tt> and a short description what's included. We recommend a C-notation
style comment:

<pre>
/* This class is part of the XP framework
 *
 * $Id$
 */
</pre> 

This comment is supposed to be written directly behind the opening <?php and is
of exactly above form. The short description should not exceed one line and the
Id-tag must be included before the first add / commit as $Id$ and just
written like that.

Opening / closing tags
----------------------
Next to <tt><?php ... ?></tt> there is no other form of opening tags allowed (e.g.
<tt><% %></tt> or <tt><? ?></tt>). This form is XML-conform and thus future safe. 
<tt><?</tt> will result in a "Not well formed" error message in any XML parser.

Filenames
---------
Filenames look like following:

<summary>
Classes
~~~~~~~
Files containing a class have to be named like the class and always contain just 
one class. The suffix is *.class.php*.
Examples: <tt>IOCollection.class.php, Object.class.php</tt>
</summary>

<summary>
Scripts
~~~~~~~
These should be named with a sensible name which will be underlined 
and clearified by the path. Word separation should be done with the underline
(<tt>_</tt>). Examples: <tt>index.php, mail_notify.php</tt>.
</summary>

Line length
-----------
Lines with more than 80 chars should not be written. Examples for documentation
purposes should even only contain no more than 70 chars (sending via
E-Mail).
