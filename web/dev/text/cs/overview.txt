Coding standards: Overview
==========================
Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons: 
<ul>
  <li>80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance. </li>
  <li>Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author. </li>
  <li>Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to 
      understand new code more quickly and thoroughly. </li>
  <li>If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it is as well 
      packaged and clean as any other product you create.</li> 
  <li>For the conventions to work, every person writing software must conform to the 
      code conventions. Everyone. </li>
</ul>
