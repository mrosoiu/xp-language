    <caption>Nagios NSCA client (Nagios Service Check Acceptor)</caption>
    <text>
      <ref type="ext" link="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</ref> is the successor
      of Netsaint, a host and service monitoring tool. Nagios checks services by,
      for example, pinging a host, testing whether a port can be connected or 
      executing any other user-defined check.
      <br/>
      There are basically two types of checks: Active and passive checks. Active
      checks are initiated by Nagios in configured intervals. Passive checks 
      results are submitted by the monitored service itself. NSCA is a client/server
      protocol that allows inter-machine status result transfers via TCP/IP.

      See <ref type="api:class" link="org.nagios.nsca.NscaClient"/> 
      for an example on how to use these classes.<br/>
