      This collection of classes lets you incorporate multi-tier application
      easily. The client has a transparent object wrapper, accessing it as
      if it was a regular class - although the code is executed on the server
      side.
      <br/>
      For a client example, see <ref type="api:class" link="rmi.RMIObject"/>.
      For details on writing a server, have a look at
      <ref type="api:class" link="rmi.server.RMIServer"/>.
