      The XP framework features an easy-to-use database abstraction layer,
      consisting of (from a user's point of view) exactly one class.<br/>
      <br/>
      Basically, all that needs to be done is use the DriverManager to
      retrieve a suitable connection object. At the moment, Sybase, MySQL,
      PostgreSQL and SQLite databases are fully supported, with more coming (as soon as
      the developers have access to one of these databases to verify their
      code actually works).
