    <introduction>
      XP is a modular framework consisting of a number of useful classes,
      making it easier to complete everyday tasks.
      <br/>
      
      The classes are written to serve your needs in any situation:
      <ul>
        <li>Command-line tools and cronjobs</li>
        <li>GUI applications with the power of GTK-PHP</li>
        <li>Web sites using HTML or XML/XSL</li>
        <li>SOAP clients/servers</li>
      </ul>
      
      XP brings you nearer to the future of PHP: All of the framework will
      be migrated to PHP5 and the Zend Engine 2 as soon as these are
      available and stable.

        <caption>Strong Typing vs. Strong Testing</caption>
        <description>
          Bruce Eckel, Author of "Thinking in Java", on static vs. dynamic typing. 
          Altough he is using Python in his article, the arguments made could be 
          adapted to PHP, too.<br/>
          <quote>
            This became a puzzle to me: if strong static type checking is so 
            important, why are people able to build big, complex Python programs 
            (with much shorter time and effort than the strong static 
            counterparts) without the disaster that I was so sure would ensue?

        <caption>Are Dynamic Languages Going to Replace Static Languages?</caption>
        <description>
          <quote>
            For many years we've been using statically typed languages for 
            the safety they offer. But now, as we all gradually adopt Test 
            Driven Development, are we going to find that safety redundant? 
            Will we therefore decide that the flexibility of dynamically 
            typed languages is desirable?
