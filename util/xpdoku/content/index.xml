      XP is a modular framework consisting of a number of useful classes,
      making it easier to complete everyday tasks.
      <br/>
      
      The classes are written to serve your needs in any situation:
      <ul>
        <li>Command-line tools and cronjobs</li>
        <li>GUI applications with the power of GTK-PHP</li>
        <li>Web sites using HTML or XML/XSL</li>
        <li>SOAP clients/servers</li>
      </ul>
      
      XP brings you nearer to the future of PHP: All of the framework will
      be migrated to PHP5 and the Zend Engine 2 as soon as these are
      available and stable.
