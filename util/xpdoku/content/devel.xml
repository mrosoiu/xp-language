          Coding Standards: Everyone codes to the same standards. 
          Ideally, you shouldn't be able to tell by looking at it who 
          on the team has touched a specific piece of code.

        Want to join the XP team? Well, there are some prerequisites...<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>First of all, it is assumed you have read the coding standards (see above).</li>
          <li>Second, you might want to subscribe to the developer's mailing list.</li>
          <li>Third, have a look at some of the tips listed - they are substantial in
              developing clean (and XP-conformant) sourcecode.

      <caption>Part 4: Documentation</caption>
      <text>
        Documentation is an essential part of the XP framework. Well documented
        code is more time consuming to write in the first place, but will save
        others a lot of time!
