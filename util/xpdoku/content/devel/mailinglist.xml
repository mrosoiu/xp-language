          Like many other development teams, the XP core team employs
          a mailinglist to discuss and announce changes and keep track
          of anything regarding our code.<br/>
          For these reasons, we at xp-framework.net offer an unmoderated
          list for developers, a list for CVS commit messages and one bug list
          where all bug mail out of our Bugzilla are sent to.

      <para>
        <caption>How to subscribe?</caption>
        <text>
          We use <quote>ezmlm</quote>, so to subscribe just send
          an email to xp-subscribe@php3.de.
          You will be replied and then need to confirm your subscription
          by answering that mail.<br/>
          If you need help with ezmlm, just send an empty message to
          xp-help@php3.de.<br/>
          <br/>
          The same method - appending '-subscribe' after the list's name applies
          to our other lists, as well; these are xp-cvs@php3.de for CVS commits and
          xp-bugs@php3.de for the bug activity.<br/>
          Posting to the lists generally require subscription due to SPAM issues.<br/>
          Archives of the mailinglists currently only exists on the developers 
          hard disks :).

          The mailinglist is used to discuss anything that has to do
          with the XP framework. That includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Any CVS commit in the public cvs</li>
            <li>Any CVS tag in the public cvs</li>
            <li>Questions about the framework that are not covered
              in our online-documentation at (www.xp-framework.net).</li>
            <li>Additional information to certain classes (that do not fit
              into inline documentation). They should be written somewhere
              but an announcement on the list helps not to overlook it.</li>
            <li>API changes that break backward compatibility MUST be
              announced (They even should be discussed before commit).
              [Note: classes that are marked as EXPERIMENTAL/NEEDS_WORK are
              allowed to be changed that way].
            </li>
          </ul>
          Generally it is a good idea for user of xp-framework to be
          subscribed on the list.
