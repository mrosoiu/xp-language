        <caption>What is CVS?</caption>
        <text>
          CVS stands for "Concurrent Versions System". Many open source projects
          use CVS to share their code among various developers.

        <caption>How do I write log messages?</caption>
        <text>
          CVS log messages really make the whole thing comprehensible and traceable. Log 
          messages just saying "Changes" or "Correct Sth." should be heavily avoided, just
          like a huge commit of many changes in many files. Instead you should clearly
          document what you changed and why. This requires discipline - to the benefit that
          anyone can understand what you did. That is better for everyone.

          The following format has been found readable:
          
          <pre><![CDATA[|----------------------------
|revision 1.9
|date: 2002/02/26 18:09:48;  author: friebe;  state: Exp;  lines: +22 -25
|- Makefile unified
|- :ext:... added
|----------------------------]]></pre>

          For every change a - is written on the beginning of the line. Further examples:
          
          <pre><![CDATA[|----------------------------
|revision 1.8
|date: 2002/02/21 14:05:02;  author: friebe;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2
|- Add an optional argument "filename"
|----------------------------]]></pre>

          <pre><![CDATA[|----------------------------
|revision 1.3
|date: 2002/02/21 13:28:46;  author: friebe;  state: Exp;  lines: +10 -9
|- Convert to CVS install
|  We have a cvs checkout on that machine, so we could directly work on
|  it and commit there in case of emergency.
|----------------------------]]></pre>

        <caption>What the thing with those STABLE - tags?</caption>
        <text>
          Setting a STABLE-tag defines that this piece can be used in a production
          environment. This is the commitment of the respective author that he
          has tested this version to a satisfying degree.
          With cvs status -v you can show all tags of a file:

          <pre><![CDATA[[...]
|   Existing Tags:
|        STABLE                          (revision: 1.12)
|        Initial                         (revision: 1.1.1.1)
|        Start                           (branch: 1.1.1)]]></pre>

          Other tags frequently used are <tt>NEEDS_WORK</tt> and <tt>EXPERIMENTAL</tt>.
