        <caption>What is CVS?</caption>
        <text>
          CVS stands for "Concurrent Versions System". Many open source projects
          use CVS to share their code among various developers.

        <caption>How do I write log messages?</caption>
        <text>
          CVS log messages really make the whole thing comprehensible and traceable. Log 
          messages just saying "Changes" or "Correct Sth." should be heavily avoided, just
          like a huge commit of many changes in many files. Instead you should clearly
          document what you changed and why. This requires discipline - to the benefit that
          anyone can understand what you did. That is better for everyone.
          <br/>
          The following format has been found readable:
          
          <pre><![CDATA[|----------------------------
|revision 1.9
|date: 2002/02/26 18:09:48;  author: friebe;  state: Exp;  lines: +22 -25
|- Makefile unified
|- :ext:... added
|----------------------------]]></pre>

          For every change a - is written on the beginning of the line. Further examples:

      <para>
        <caption>Comments in CVS log messages</caption>
        <text>
          When commiting, one somebody feels the desire to add some more information 
          to the log message, such as reasoning for the commit or further references
          (such as howtos, documentation, bug links) which actually have nothing to 
          do with the changes themselves.
          <br/>
          Use a # to prefix these "comments".
          <pre><![CDATA[|----------------------------

        <caption>Quality assurance work</caption>
        <text>
          From time to time, classes undergo a quality assurance phase. That means
          they are checked for possible error conditions, coding standards or whether
          their api documentation still conforms to the current behaviour.
          <br/>
          Commits serving these purposes will be prefixed with <tt>QA</tt>. Example:
          <pre><![CDATA[|----------------------------
|revision 1.42
|date: 2004/02/16 21:59:14;  author: friebe;  state: Exp;  lines: +1 -1

      <para>
        <caption>Abbreviations used in CVS commit messages</caption>
        <text>
          The following abbreviations (all in capital letters) are used in log messages:
          
          <ul>
            <li><b>MFH</b>: Merge from Head (when working with branches)</li>
            <li><b>MFP</b>: Merge from Public (when working with separate CVS repositories)</li>
            <li><b>WS</b>: Whitespace</li>
            <li><b>CS</b>: Coding standards</li>
            <li><b>TBD</b>: To be discussed</li>
            <li><b>TODO</b>: (self-explanatory)</li>
          </ul>

      <para>
        <caption>What's the thing with those STABLE - tags?</caption>
        <text>
          Setting a STABLE-tag defines that this piece can be used in a production
          environment. This is the commitment of the respective author that he
          has tested this version to a satisfying degree.
          With cvs status -v you can show all tags of a file:

          <pre><![CDATA[[...]
|   Existing Tags:
|        STABLE                          (revision: 1.12)
|        Initial                         (revision: 1.1.1.1)
|        Start                           (branch: 1.1.1)]]></pre>

          Other tags frequently used are <tt>NEEDS_WORK</tt> and <tt>EXPERIMENTAL</tt>.
