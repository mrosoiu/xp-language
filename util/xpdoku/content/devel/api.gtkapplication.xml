        <text>
          Due to a found bug in the gui.gtk.GtkApplication class 
          that was found around July 21, an API change has been 
          made to above mentioned class. The class' constructor 
          now must be passed a reference to an util.cmd.ParamString
          object which should contain information about the invocation 
          parameters of the application.<br/>
          Until now, the gtkphp script which is used to launch 
          gtk-php applications did pass a ParamString to the constructor, 
          but it was left up to the derived implementation to process 
          its contents. It was found to be a base functionality, so 
          design was changed to give it up to GtkApplication::__construct(). 
          A reference is now stored in GtkApplication->param, so it 
          is accessible to the whole app.
