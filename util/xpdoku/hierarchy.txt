* index.html contains an overview for all included packages
* showsource.php is source-highlighter

All files (incl. .html) are parsed through the PHP-Processor,
so we can nicely show actual time (at upper right corner).

* source is not a real directory on the server but is being
  created by a apache-rewriterule:
  ,---
  | RewriteEngine On
  | RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/source/.*$
  | RewriteRule ^/source/(.*)$ /showsource.php?f=$1
  `---
* search is being created the same way as source
  it is a rewrite to /search.php
  search.php is an intelligent search script that is able to
  do "approximate class searching":
  /search.php?keyword=spsybase redirect to classes/rdbms.sybase.SPSybase.html
