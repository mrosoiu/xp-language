Creating executables from PHP sourcecode
======================================================================
$Id$

How is this accomplished?
-------------------------
We simply use SAPI/embed which was actually written for embedding PHP 
sourcecode in programs written in C.
See http://www.zend.com/lists/php-dev/200209/msg01063.html for details

The generator, php2cembed.php, creates C sourcecode from a PHP script,
adds an errorhandler and dumps the contents to stdout. To see what
is done, simply use php -q php2cembed.php /path/to/your/script.php

This C sourcecode is then compiled and libphp4.a is statically linked
to it. This way, no external library is needed except for those 
dynamically linked to libphp4.a. This behaviour may be changed by
configure-options of PHPs configure.

How do I create libphp4.a?
--------------------------
Call PHPs configure with --disable-cli --enable-embed=yes --enable-static
to create libphp4.a and libphp4.la

What to do from here?
---------------------
Open your favorite shell and type "make exe src=/path/to/your/script.php".
You may need to specify the directory in which libphp4.a and libphp4.la
reside, so append "PHPLIBDIR=/path/to/.a_and_.la_files/" to your command
line.

What software is needed?
------------------------
- gcc
- libtool
- php (command-line version, CGI will do)

The build process was tested with gcc 2.95.4, libtool 1.4.3 and php 4.2.3
