Creating executables from PHP sourcecode
======================================================================
$Id$

How is this accomplished?
-------------------------
We simply use SAPI/embed which was actually written for embedding PHP 
sourcecode in programs written in C.
See http://www.zend.com/lists/php-dev/200209/msg01063.html for details

The generator, php2cembed.php, creates C sourcecode from a PHP script,
adds an errorhandler and dumps the contents to stdout. To see what
is done, simply use php -q php2cembed.php /path/to/your/script.php

This C sourcecode is then compiled and libphp4.a is statically linked
to it. This way, no external library is needed except for those 
dynamically linked to libphp4.a. This behaviour may be changed by
configure-options of PHPs configure.

How do I create libphp4.a?
--------------------------
Call PHPs configure with --disable-cli --enable-embed=yes --enable-static
to create libphp4.a and libphp4.la

What to do from here?
---------------------
Open your favorite shell and type "make exe src=/path/to/your/script.php".
You may need to specify the directory in which libphp4.a and libphp4.la
reside, so append "PHPLIBDIR=/path/to/.a_and_.la_files/" to your command
line.

What software is needed?
------------------------
- gcc
- libtool
- php (command-line version, CGI will do)

The build process was tested with gcc 2.95.4, libtool 1.4.3 and php 4.2.3

Misc: The error handler
-----------------------
The builtin error handler dumps messages to stderr in this kind of
fashion:

*** Error #2 on line 2 of test
    fopen(http://localhost/notfound) [http://www.php.net/function.fopen]: 
    failed to create stream: HTTP request failed! HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
*** Error #2 on line 4 of test
    fgets(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource
*** Error #2 on line 7 of test
    fclose(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource

Parse errors will look like this:
*** Error #4 on line 6 of test
    parse error, unexpected '}'
*** Internal error

<EOF>
